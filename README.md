# MarkdownParserAndroid
A multi-functional and easy way to integrate markdown formatting within Android apps.

### Integration guide
When using gradle, the library can easily be imported into the build.gradle file of your project. Add the following dependency:

    compile 'com.crescentflare.markdownparser:MarkdownParserLib:0.1.0'

Make sure that jcenter is added as a repository.

### Example
The provided example shows how to parse markdown, convert it to html and show it on a text view.

### Status
The library is new and currently just a prototype to parse limited set of markdown and (optionally) convert it to html using java and native code. The goal is to turn this into a flexible markdown utility library.
